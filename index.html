    <h1>Dear Friends,</h1>
    <p>As you know, I’m about to embark on a new chapter in my life and will be moving away. It's with a mix of excitement and sadness that I write this message. I’m thrilled for the new opportunities and experiences that await me, but it’s incredibly hard to say goodbye to all of you who have been such an important part of my life.<br><br>Each of you has made a significant impact on me. Our friendships have meant the world to me, and it's tough to imagine not seeing your faces regularly.<br><br>Thank you for the incredible moments we've shared. Your friendship has been a true blessing, and I will carry each of you in my heart as I move forward. This isn’t goodbye forever, just goodbye for now.<br><br>Take care, stay amazing, and keep making beautiful memories. I will miss you all dearly. Now, you can login with your special code to, well, let's just say, see your own special page...<br><br>With love and gratitude,<br>Swarit Choudhari</p>
